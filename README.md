>Introductions
This is a autohotkey script made to get some automation into your workflow for sorting customer files. It can do things like auto
Index with a key combination so you wont have to select each files type manually ussualy saving up to 30 seconds per Index.

>Disclaimer:
This is a autohotkey script meant o work with the portable version of autohotkey.
This is a script meant to automate the user workflow for sorting customer files in ELO. The script is not perfect
because it is depandant on relative positions and exact timing of certain key actions. This script is made to function with
establishment Enschede this means it will require tweaking to some extend to make it work for other establishments. It's also not fully
automatic and can't handle things like png files and automaticly deleting useless things like empty pages, this all requires manual work
by the user. sorting has to be done by hand to but when the PDF files have been sorted they can be automaticly put into the
right Index in ELO. Things like PNG files have to be converted to PDF files manually so they can be indexed in ELO.

>Functions:
The script is able to do the following (orderend in action per keybind function):
  -Automaticly delete the previous sorted folder, move the next new folder to ELO, split the newly moved PDF files.
  -Automaticly put in the right Customer ID and name.
  -automaticly Index to Financial letter, KvK documents & SEPA agreements.
